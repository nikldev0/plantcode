Hello, thanks for stopping by üëãüèΩ I'm a junior software engineer at [Nightingale HQ](https://nightingalehq.ai/). This blog is a respository of my progress, thoughts, doubts, and epiphanies. Opinions here are my own. 

If you'd like to get in touch you can send me an email at nikhil.kanukuntla@protonmail.com, or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-ka/). My [GitHub](https://github.com/nikldev0) will keep you updated on any projects I'm working on. I'm also around on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikl_0), but I try not to spend too much time on social media.
