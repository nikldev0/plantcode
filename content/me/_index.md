Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm a self-taught junior software engineer at [Nightingale HQ](https://nightingalehq.ai/). This blog is a respository of my progress, thoughts, doubts, and epiphanies. Opinions here are my own.

If you'd like to get in touch with me you can fire an email, or connect on LinkedIn. I'm also around on Twitter, but I try not to spend too much time on social media.
